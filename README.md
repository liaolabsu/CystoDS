# CystoDS: A Benchmark Dataset for Cystoscopic Image Classification
CystoDS is the first public dataset designed specifically for cystoscopic image classification, encompassing a wide range of clinically relevant categories such as tumors (malignant and benign), anatomical structures, foreign bodies, and normal mucosa. The dataset is curated with verified pathology labels and has been validated using multiple state-of-the-art models from the OpenMMLab MMPRETRAIN framework.

This repository provides documentation, trained models, and evaluation results. The training code is not included here, as all model implementations are publicly available through OpenMMLab.
